## How to run
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run the entire test suite using Maven:

3. To run a specific test, you can use the tags defined in the feature files. For example, if you want to run a test tagged as **@create_pet**, you can use the following command:
```
mvn clean test "-Dkarate.options=--tags @create_pet"
```
Replace **@create_pet** with the desired tag for the specific test you want to run.
